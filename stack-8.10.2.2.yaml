# Liang-Ting Chen, 2020-12-23:
# This stack configuration is essentially the same as stack-8.10.2.yaml.
# The official ghc release of 8.10.2 does not work on Windows due to a bug, see
# https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18550.
#
# Ghc 8.10.2.2 is provided by Chocolatey to fix the issue, but
# it is not available via stack.
